1. Discord is probably the best.
2. Respond within 24-48 hrs but obviously the earlier the better.
3. Always be respectful and give constructive feedback
4. Be open to feedback
5. If we are stuck on anything, we should schedule a time sit down and work it out.

Communication Contract
1. I am available 9pm-12pm central and occasionally throughout the day but I do work full time so may not be able to answer right away. 
2. If you need specific help on the microservice, please message me at any time and I will try and respond asap.
3. I will be available on weekends for majority of the time.
